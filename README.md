This repository contains the Python implementation for computational
experiments used in the MSc thesis:
"Approximation Algorithms and Computational Experiments for the Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem".
The code implements the LP relaxation and heuristic algorithms for the
Prize-Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem (PCTSP) and was used to
generate the experimental results reported in the thesis.
